this is a very simple config solution for nvim.
i believe that the simplest solution to a problem is the most elegant one,
and that's why I keep this config as minimal as possible (for my own purposes ofc).

i like using space as my leader key, ctrl hurts my pinky. if you use ctrl shortcuts regularly,
it may not hurt you but you should probably stop before getting carpal tunnel.

this config has
- lazy for package management
- treesitter for syntax highlighting
- oil for filesystem manipulation
- telescope for finding and grepping files
- harpoon for switching files and terminals quickly
- fugitive for git management
- mason, null-ls, luasnip, for lsp, completions, autoformatting, and snippets
